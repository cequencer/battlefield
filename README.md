# battlefield
This is a game to play with your friends. You need to focus you attention on the moves your opponents can play and beat them using your Game Theory acknowledgements.

### Rules
---
1. **#people** find three other friends to play (you can play in less than 4 people, but it's much less fun)
2. **#environment** players are called *fighters* and the play against each other. They can have superpower or not.
3. **#arrays** in order to play each player must give the *master* (the referee) an array and a nickname
4. **#play!** just read code snippet, see how it works and win
5. **#winner** to see who won, the *master* might find it useful to run the script provided (![python](https://github.com/sirfoga/battlefield/blob/master/battlefield.py "python") and ![javascript](https://github.com/sirfoga/battlefield/blob/master/battlefield.js "javascript"))
